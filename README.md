# 🏗️ System Design & Design Patterns in Java

Welcome to the **System Design and Design Patterns** repository! This project is a curated collection of core design patterns and system design concepts implemented in **Java**, with real-world analogies and clean code examples.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To help learners, interviewees, and developers understand and implement **system design** principles and **object-oriented design patterns**, with a focus on:

- Clarity & simplicity
- Real-world use cases
- Interview preparation

---

## 🧠 Design Patterns Included

Each design pattern is implemented in its own folder with:
- Java code examples
- Diagrams (optional)
- A `README.md` explaining the pattern and code

| Pattern Name | Folder | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Adapter Pattern | [`adapter-pattern`](./StructuralDesign/AdapterPattern) | Convert one interface into another expected by the client. |
|
| ... | ... | More coming soon! |
